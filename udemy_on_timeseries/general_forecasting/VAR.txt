- General Steps involved in building a VAR model:
   - Examine the data
   - Visualize the data
   - Test for stationarity
   - Select appropriate order p -> auto_arima again
   - instantiate the model and fit it to a training set
   - if necessary, invert the earlier transformation
   - evaluate model predictions against a known test set
   - forecast future
