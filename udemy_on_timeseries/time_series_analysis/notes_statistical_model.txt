# 3 different trends,
# upward, horizontal/stationary, downward
# time-series can have any number of combination of these

# seasonality :- repeating trends

# cyclical - trends with no set repetition
# there is no definable trends in period

# if we can determine the period of the trend
# it is seasonal, otherwise it is cyclical
# because some trends happen in combination
# (for example up down up down) but
# we can't patternize the period of these
# cycles

# Hodrick-Prescott filter :-
# y(t) = trend(t) + cyclical(t)
# y(t) = time-series
# trend(t) = trend component
# cyclical(t) = cyclical component

# bascially it is saying, all time-series
# data is composed of some trend-component
# mixed with some cyclical component

Now, these "components"(trend and cyclical)
are determined by minimizing the following
quadratic loss function, where lambda is a 
smoothing parameter: (google the equation if in question)

lambda handles variations in the growth rate
of the trend component (good default value
for lambda is 1600 for quaterly data and
use 6.25 for annual data, whereas we are recommended
to use 129,600 for monthly data)
