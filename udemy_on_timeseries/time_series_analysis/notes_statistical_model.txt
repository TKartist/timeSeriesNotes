# 3 different trends,
# upward, horizontal/stationary, downward
# time-series can have any number of combination of these

# seasonality :- repeating trends

# cyclical - trends with no set repetition
# there is no definable trends in period

# if we can determine the period of the trend
# it is seasonal, otherwise it is cyclical
# because some trends happen in combination
# (for example up down up down) but
# we can't patternize the period of these
# cycles

# Hodrick-Prescott filter :-
# y(t) = trend(t) + cyclical(t)
# y(t) = time-series
# trend(t) = trend component
# cyclical(t) = cyclical component

# bascially it is saying, all time-series
# data is composed of some trend-component
# mixed with some cyclical component

Now, these "components"(trend and cyclical)
are determined by minimizing the following
quadratic loss function, where lambda is a 
smoothing parameter: (google the equation if in question)

lambda handles variations in the growth rate
of the trend component (good default value
for lambda is 1600 for quaterly data and
use 6.25 for annual data, whereas we are recommended
to use 129,600 for monthly data)

# search up, the reason for lambda default values

#ETS models (Error-Trend-Seasonality) includes
 - Exponential smoothing
 - Trend Methods models
 - ETS Decomposition
ETS models will take each of those terms (Error, trend and seasonality)
for "smoothing" and may add, multiply or leave them out.
Based off these key factors, we can create a model that fits our data.

# Statsmodels provide a seasonal decomposition tool
we can use to separate out the different components (trend, cyclical etc.)
i.e. Hodrick-Prescott filter

# Time series decomposition with ETS
 - Visualizing the data based on its ETS is a good way to build an
 understanding of its behaviors

So why do we decompose it:
When Error, Trend and seasonality are mixed (common in real-life data),
it is harder to spot them individually. Hence, we "decompose" the data
into different components and view them individually for clarity.

# Two types of main ETS models
 - Additive (when trend is linear)
 - Multiplicative (when trend is non-linear)

# Exponential Weighted Moving Average Model (EWMA Model)

# we can expand on SMA to build EWMA
more weight to recent and lower weight to older data
try to avoid weakness of SMA -> i.e.
 - smaller windows will lead to more noise, rather than signal
 - it will always lag by the size of the window
 - it will never reach to full peak of valley of the data due to the averaging
   graph it to confirm
 - it actually doesn't inform you about possible future behavior,
   all it actually does is describe trends in your data
 - Also extreme historical values can skew SMA significantly
# EWMA is used to evade some of these problems

# Equation for EWMA
 - EWMA will allow us to reduce the lag effect from SMA
 - more weight on values that occured more recently
 - amount of weight applied to the most recent values will depend on
   actual parameters used in the EWMA and the number of periods
   given a window size

 - y(t) = sum_02t(w_i * x_(i-1)) / sum_02t(w_i)

 - so how do we decide w_i?
 - if we expand we get y(t) = ((1 - alpha) ^ n * x_(t-n)) / (1 - alpha) ^ n
 - where n = {0 <= n <= t && n is an integer}
 - so basically, to "alpha" is a smoothing factor (control variable)!!!
 - alpha can be adjusted through "span" "center of mass", or "half-life"
 - i.e. = alpha = 2 / (span + 1) -> higher span = lower alpha
 - in our EWMA script example we used df.ewm(span=12)


# Holt Winters Methods
 - EWMA has "ONE smoothing factor alpha" which failed to account for
   other factors like trend and seasonality
 - Using double Exponential smoothing method (from Holt)
 - 3 components -> l(t) = level (alpha as smoothing component)
                -> b(t) = trend (beta as smoothing component)
                -> s(t) = seasonal (gamma as smoothing component)
 - 2 variations which differ in terms of the seasonal component

# Single Exponential Smoothing (what we did in Exponential Smoothing)
 - y_0 = x_0
 - y(t) = (1 - alpha) * y_(t - 1) + alpha * x_t

# Double Exponential Smoothing (aka. Holt's method)
 - New Smoothing factor "beta" is introduced, which addresses the trend
 - l(t) = level = (1 - alpha) * l_(t - 1) + alpha * x_t
 - b(t) = trend = (1 - beta) * b_(t - 1) + beta * x_t
 - y(t) = l(t) + b(t)                                       # fitted model
 - forecast(y_(t + h)) = l(t) + h * b(t)                    # forecasting model (h = *periods into the future)
 - With this model, we would be able to forecast the basic trend (upward, stationary, downward etc.)
 - However, it wouldn't be possible to predict seasonality (like in airline passenger info we had) like
   there are more passengers during the summer than winter and etc.
   Hence, we use "Holt-Winters method" which can predict the seasonality as well (aka. Triple Exponential Smoothing)

# Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Method)
 - Third smoothing component, "gamma", incorporates the seasonality
 - l(t) = level = (1 - alpha) * l_(t - 1) + alpha * x_t
 - b(t) = trend = (1 - beta) * b_(t - 1) + beta * (l_t - l_(t - 1))
 - c(t) = seasonality = (1 - gamma) * c_(t - L) + gamma * (x_t - l_(t - 1) - b_(t - 1))
 - y(t) = (l(t) + b(t)) * c(t)
 - forecast(y(t + m)) = (l(t) + m * b(t)) * c_(t - L + 1 + (m - 1) mod L)
 - m = # periods into the future
 - L = length of a cycle -> i.e. if yearly info L = 12
